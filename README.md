# Popcorn-t
R-code for SNP-based heritability analyses.  The methodology is an extension of brielin/Popcorn
- by incorporating the dependence of per-SNP heritability on allele frequency and LD-related functional annotations
- to use t-distribution for modeling allele substitution effect of SNPs

Run popcorn_example.R
